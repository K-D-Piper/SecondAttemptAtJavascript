// Welcome to my section of notes.
JavaScript is a language to be layered on top of an HTML page to cause more fun elaborate effects. 

In early sages; JavaScript's language is written in forumals that will then be added together and connected/linked to the your page through use of "console.log()"
    // console.log () connects your coding page to webpage. At least at the start. 

The statements work as followed/as written 

"Statement + Declaration = Data Type " OR "Variable + variable name = data type "
    How you write these is through use of RESERVED WORDS (also called methods) which are prevously defined words in JavaScript, bascailly so you and your computer know what you want/what you're trying to do. 
        So in the end, how you'll basicilly write it is " Reserved Word + Variable Name = Data Type"

* Just to further clarify text above; the addition sign is just to show that these items need to be connected. They are not needed/reccommneded during the actual act of making code. 

// Reserved Words are the preset list of words that communicated the desired action of the variable. 
// Declaration are the named YOU give the item that needs the desired effect. 
// Data types are the only metrics that can be used. 

//Data Types. 
    Currently we are learning 5 data types. 
        Strings : "Strings" / 'Strings' : Quation Words/ words that need to be indiviualed and defined
        Numbers : 1- infinity : 
        Booleans: True/False:
